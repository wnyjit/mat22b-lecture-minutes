>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>DESIGNED TO USE IN TANDEM WITH THE "CANVAS MEDIA GALERY"<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
ive decided to release my collection of lecture minutes in the hopes that it aids you in your study like it has for me 

spelling is not universal and THERE ARE TYPOS, so if "ctrl-f" doesnt catch it then check with different spelling(for example, DE vs diff eq,, existance vs existence,, first order vs 1st order)

im also not the most thorough, so THERE ARE TOPICS THAT CAN BE MISSED 

the minute associated with a topic is not dead accurate. the topic covered is usually 1 or so minute before it's actually brought up in lecture


the usual organization form:


+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
topic - minute (usually +-1,2 minutes of topic actually being brought up)
  subtopic - minute
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

================================================================================================================================    <<<---- day seperator
================================================================================================================================

+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
topic - minute 
  subtopic - minute
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
